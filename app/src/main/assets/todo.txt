* THINGS TO IMPLEMENT *
---------------------
- Make sure the user uploaded posts and user liked posts are in descending sorted order.
    Also there should be MAX limit on how many user uploaded/liked posts I pull from cloud
    and pull more as user scrolls down the list

- Try to fetch user posts without negative actionTimestamp (maybe do get `limitToLast`)

- Make sure post author/owner cannot repost the prismPost

- Revamp `DisplayUsersActivity.getListOfUsers()`
- Revamp `PrismUserProfileActivity`
